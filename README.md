 Import the dataset and explore basic info (nu ls, data types).
 Handle missing values using mean/median/imputation.
 Convert categorical features into numerical using encoding.
 Normalize/standardize the numerical features.
 Visualize outliers using boxplots and remove them.


Survival vs Gender:
Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
"Women and children first" is clearly reflected in survival distribution.

Survival vs Passenger Class (Pclass):
1st class passengers had significantly higher survival rates.
3rd class had the lowest — likely due to lower cabin location and delayed access to lifeboats.

Age Distribution:
Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.
Children (under 10) had above-average survival rates.

Fare Distribution:
Fare is right-skewed — majority paid low fare, but a few paid extremely high.
Higher fare generally correlated with higher survival (those in 1st class).

Family Onboard (SibSp & Parch):
Having 1–2 family members onboard slightly improved survival chances.
Too many relatives (e.g., 5+) was rare and often not helpful for survival.
